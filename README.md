## Description:

---

PillPal is an app that helps you manage your medication schedule with ease, so you never miss a dose or accidentally take the wrong medication.

## Usage:

---

- You can easily add your medication regimen and set reminders for each dose. Our app generates reminders that show up on your home screen every day, so you don't have to worry about forgetting to take your medication.
- After you add your medication, the app generates a reminder for each dose, and you can easily mark it as "taken", "upcoming", or "skipped" right from the home screen. We also have a killer feature that sets us apart from other apps: our Rx autocomplete. When you enter the name of your medication, "pillpal" automatically fills in the strength and dosage information, saving you time and reducing the chance of errors.

- You can try the app by downloading Expo app and open this link or scan the QR code below on your device:
